CCEHC_to_akmaxsat is a combination of the stochastic local search solver CCEHC and the complete solver akmaxsat. The procedures of CCEHC_to_akmaxsat are described as follows.

1. CCEHC_to_akmaxsat first utilizes CCEHC to find an upper bound and the corresponding assignment.

2. CCEHC_to_akmaxsat then passes the upper bound and the corresponding assignment to akmaxsat, and finally calls akmaxsat to solve the instance.
