CCLS_to_akmaxsat is a combination of the stochastic local search solver CCLS and the complete solver akmaxsat. The procedures of CCLS_to_akmaxsat are described as follows.

1. CCLS_to_akmaxsat first utilizes CCLS to find an upper bound and the corresponding assignment.

2. CCLS_to_akmaxsat then passes the upper bound and the corresponding assignment to akmaxsat, and finally calls akmaxsat to solve the instance.
